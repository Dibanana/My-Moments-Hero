GAMEPLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking to create a fun 2D platform adventure.
Emphasis on fluid movement and attacks that assist in movement as well.

I will have 3 weapons equipped at all times, yet there'll be at least 10 obtainable weapons (Something like 25 weapons would be ideal, but I imagine that would pose obvious issues.) and I'll be able to switch through each equipped weapon through scrolling or numbers

The rest of the weapons will be stored in an inventory and allowed to be swapped in from the pause (or equipment) menu.

Each weapon will have an attack, secondary action, and a special action

EXAMPLE: SHIELD
[LeftClick]   [RightClick]   [Q]
ATTACK - - - - BLOCK - - - - THROW SHIELD/RETURN SHIELD

(While the shield may not provide direct movement advantage, it can be thrown into a dynamic object to inflict high knockback to the object. It can also be thrown to stick itself into a [Brown] wall to be used as a platform as well.)

EXAMPLE: GUN
[LeftClick]   [RightClick]    [Q]
ATTACK - - - - RELOAD - - - - CHARGED BULLET

(The gun will provide regular ranged attacks with a small knockback effect to the player. Use the [DownButton] to aim the gun down and bounce character upwards slightly. Normal attacks won't be very useful, but the special Charged Bullet has the same forcepower as a double jump.)


The game is intended to just be puzzles, bosses, and areas of gameplay without much story. However, there will be lore items and characters around checkpoints that would be willing to have conversations with the player. I don't think I've met anyone whom I look up to enough to provide important lore items or a story worth giving investment in, but anything is better than nothing.

I may already be arrogant by saying this, but I think I can trust myself in creating a story. I just need artists to provide me the required assets.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking to make this in a cartoonish fantasy-like setting.
I don't want the player to have any reliance on straight up magic because I really like having actual equipment imbued with magic for their own little niche purposes. (Also I don't like mana bars.)

If possible, I want a magical world setting where magic once existed, but its secrets were lost and humanity simply moved on.

The story will need to be lighthearted. Not essentially aimed towards children, but family friendly enough to play with children. (Ideally PG, but PG-13 if need be)

Something that I want to make clear as a reminder to myself and anyone working on this is that I want to keep myself from writing myself into a corner. There needs to be more than depth to the story, but also breadth. (Look it up, that's a word.)
What I mean to say is that I want to just lightly touch on a few topics without making my theme revolve around them.

**I just want a simple story that tells the audience we can still look forward to the future.** 
Just include typical life advice. (Be responsible, be kind, grow from your mistakes, etc.)

Life advice is like veggies, don't let them the babies(Players) know that it has deeper meaning until after it's given.

(I know I won't use anything here, but seek versatility for where these ideas could be boss fights)
List of random ideas:
Mecha Santa
Queen of Bugs
Dark Knight + Dragon
Kindergarten teacher
Mad Scientist + Army of Clones
Tentacle monster
Redneck cousins
God of the Void
Howard, the office worker
Aspiring artist's domain

ART
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need more direction or details on anything, just ask me directly and tell me how much detail I should go into or what specifically I should focus on. But for any and all matters of uncertainty, I will always be completely fine if you just improvise and seek feedback later.

   **(I've never given art direction before, so your patience will be highly appreciated)**




- - - NOTE FOR ALL ARTISTS - - -

UI: SIZE & RATIO
For every weapon/item sprite in inventory, the size ratio will be **1:1** and the pixel count will be ideally **64X64**

CHARACTER SIZE: Ratio **1:2** Pixels **256X512** (I'm willing to compromise if it turns out different, but I am keeping the hitbox ratio the same)

ENEMY SIZE: TBD (Once the enemies are created I can make a list)

TERRAIN TEXTURE: Ratio **Infinity:1** Pixels **InfiniteX256** (I'll be honest, I don't know how texturing works.)

VOID FILL: **Infinite:Infinite** (For art to fill in any unused space that the background won't be using already IE: Below Ground, Beyond walls)

- - - PLAYER // CHARACTERS - - -

I want something simple and comfortable. Childlike, if possible, with a single article of clothing having vibrant colors to stand out.

At this stage I havent figured out who the main character is. Only a generic outline. I want you to bring the topic up when you're ready.

Boy, Girl, Robot Alien Vending Machine. Flip a coin and move forward.
Just make sure that the character seems approachable and friendly.
Best I can provide for a description is just some generic emotional traits that will likely last until production phase.
**Happy-Go-Lucky|Naive|Bubbly|Energetic|Youthful|Kindhearted**

Our character will be making friends throughout their journey, even friends who initially don't like people at all, so they need to seem like the type of person who will stubbornly seek friendships on their own initiative. (As one would call it "Rabid Altruist"... I think, probably)

Further character details will be provided either on discord or a shared document once production begins. *(Remind me to do it if I forget to mention it.)*

If I can ask a lot from the artist, I will ask that all basic enemies share the same or similar art styles to the player. Then each boss fight will provide unique art styles representative to the boss's characteristics. (More details will be made once the bosses are fleshed out down the road.) Only try to consider if the artist, or any artist that's available, is actually capable of providing regular good quality work in alternate directive styles. Half-assing it will play out worse than not trying, I don't want to waste anyone's time if it looks like it won't work so I'll be brutally honest to scrap the idea if I'm not satisfied.

- - - ENVIRONMENT - - -

You'd probably already know what you're doing, but I'll restate what should be generally understood for any environment artist.

As much as we all love vibrant colors, choose primarily subtle colors for the scenes that don't steal a lot of attention. If there are vibrant colors, coordinate with the character artist to make sure they are complementary with the enemies that will be deployed in the area you're working on. Environments can be as beautiful or simple as you see fit because I trust you to have a better understanding of design philosophy than I do.

Once you obtain your description of your environment, you'll have full freedom over how you want to represent the area. Remember to communicate! If you want more direction or details, ask. If you feel like there's an idea would be interesting, talk. Ideally, I want to be as hands off as possible, but if that poses an issue then I can also dictate over any uncertainies as well if that's what's asked of me.

We will test, implement, and then provide feedback for every submission to make sure that everything works in execution.

I will be providing descriptions, aspect ratios, as well as preferred pixel sizes for the various platforms we'll be using once the foundational gameplay becomes cemented. Further details should either be shared on discord or through a shared document once we come around to the matter. 
*(Again, remind me if I forget.)*


 - - - HUD Design - - -

 I have no idea how to do this or what you may need to do your job. If possible, I'd be real with you and say you're on your own.
 However, that may sound heartless of me.
 Reality is that I'll literally accept anything as long as you remain consistent in your quality.

 But if you need help, we can always check up to see what feedback we can provide.

Other than the main menu screen, pause screen, equipment screen, and gameplay HUD. I don't know what to ask of you. I may just make a very basic form of what the game will look like without you, then you can make it your job to fix my ugly design choices as I follow and implement your improvements.
