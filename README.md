GAMEPLAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I'm looking to create a fun 2D platform adventure.
Emphasis on fluid movement and attacks that assist in movement as well.

I will have 3 weapons equipped at all times, and I'll be able to switch through scrolling or numbers

Each weapon will have an attack, secondary action, and a special action


EXAMPLE: SHIELD
[Left click]   [Right click] [Q]
ATTACK - - - - BLOCK - - - - THROW SHIELD

(While the shield may not provide direct movement advantage, it can be thrown into a dynamic object to inflict high knockback to the object. It can also be thrown into a wooden wall and used as a platform as well.)

EXAMPLE: GUN
[Left click]   [Right click]  [Q]
ATTACK - - - - RELOAD - - - - CHARGED BULLET

(The gun will provide regular ranged attacks with a small knockback effect to the player. Aim the gun down to bounce character upwards slightly. Normal attacks won't be very useful, but a fully charged attack aimed down has the same forcepower as a double jump.)


The game is intended to just be puzzles, bosses, and areas of gameplay without much story. I don't think I've met anyone whom I look up to enough to provide good lore items or a worthwhile story.

I may be arrogant in saying this, but I think I can trust myself in creating a story. I just need artists to provide me the required assets.

STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm looking to make this in a cartoonish fantasy-like setting.
I don't want the player to have any reliance on magic because I really like having actual equipment have purposes for matters like these.
If possible, I want a semi-magical world setting that's not specific to a predefined template or archetype.

The story will need to be lighthearted. Not essentially aimed towards children, but family friendly enough to play with children. (Ideally PG, but PG-13 if need be)

Something that I want to make clear as a reminder to myself and anyone working on this is that I want to keep myself from digging myself into a niche hole of ideas. There needs to be a variety of bosses, areas, enemies, and scenarios to keep the game interesting. Don't overly zoom in on any specific ideas and allow many ideas to be produced at once.

(I know I won't use anything here, but seek versatility for where these ideas could be boss fights)
List of random ideas:
Mecha Santa
Queen of Bugs
Dark Knight + Dragon
Kindergarten teacher
Mad Scientist + Army of Clones
Tentacle monster
Redneck cousins
God of the Void
